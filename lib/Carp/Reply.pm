# ABSTRACT: get a repl on exceptions in your program

use Reply;
use Reply::Config;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -MCarp::Reply script.pl

or

  use Carp::Reply ();

  sub foo {
      # ...
      Carp::Reply::repl();
      # ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Carp::Reply provides a repl to use within an already running program, which can
introspect the current state of the program, including the call stack and
current lexical variables. It works just like L<Reply>, with the addition of
some commands to move around in the call stack.

The lexical environment is set to the lexical environment of the current stack
frame (and is updated when you use any of the commands which move around the
stack frames).

Carp::Reply also installs a C<__DIE__> handler which automatically launches a
repl when an exception is thrown. You can suppress this behavior by passing an
empty import list, either via C<use Carp::Reply ();> or C<perl -mCarp::Reply>.
